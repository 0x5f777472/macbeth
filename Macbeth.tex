            \dia{Banq.} That trusted home, \\ Might yet enkindle you vnto the Crowne, \\ Besides the \textit{Thane} of Cawdor. But 'tis strange: \\ And oftentimes, to winne vs to our harme, \\ The Instruments of Darknesse tell vs Truths, \\ Winne vs with honest Trifles, to betray's \\ In deepest consequence. \\ Cousins, a word, I pray you.

            \dia{Macb.} Two Truths are told, \\ As happy Prologues to the swelling Act \\ Of the Imperiall Theame. I thanke you Gentlemen: \\ This supernaturall solliciting \\ Cannot be ill; cannot be good. \\ If ill? why hath it giuen me earnest of successe, \\ Commencing in a Truth? I am \textit{Thane} of Cawdor. \\ If good? why doe I yeeld to that suggestion, \\ Whose horrid Image doth vnfixe my Heire, \\ And make my seated Heart knock at my Ribbes, \\ Against the vse of Nature? Present Feares \\ Are lesse then horrible Imaginings: \\ My Thought, whose Murther yet is but fantasticall, \\ Shakes so my single state of Man, \\ That Function is smother'd in surmise, \\ And nothing is, but what is not.

            \dia{Macb.} Come what come may, \\ Time, and the Houre, runs through the roughest Day
