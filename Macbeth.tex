            \dia{Macb.} Two Truths are told, \\ As happy Prologues to the swelling Act \\ Of the Imperiall Theame. I thanke you Gentlemen: \\ This supernaturall solliciting \\ Cannot be ill; cannot be good. \\ If ill? why hath it giuen me earnest of successe, \\ Commencing in a Truth? I am \textit{Thane} of Cawdor. \\ If good? why doe I yeeld to that suggestion, \\ Whose horrid Image doth vnfixe my Heire, \\ And make my seated Heart knock at my Ribbes, \\ Against the vse of Nature? Present Feares \\ Are lesse then horrible Imaginings: \\ My Thought, whose Murther yet is but fantasticall, \\ Shakes so my single state of Man, \\ That Function is smother'd in surmise, \\ And nothing is, but what is not.

            \dia{La.} O proper stuffe: \\ This is the very painting of your feare: \\ This is the Ayre-drawne-Dagger which you said \\ Led you to \textit{Duncan}. O, these flawes and starts \\ (Impostors to true feare) would well become \\ A womans story, at a Winters fire \\ Authoriz'd by her Grandam: shame it selfe, \\ Why do you make such faces? When all's done \\ You looke but on a stoole.

            \dia{Macb.} Prythee see there: \\ Behold, looke, loe, how say you: \\ Why what care I, if thou canst nod, speake too. \\ If Charnell houses, and our Graues must send \\ Those that we bury, backe; our Monuments \\ Shall be the Mawes of Kytes.

            \dia{La.} What? quite vnmann'd in folly.

            \dia{Macb.} If I stand heere, I saw him.

            \dia{La.} Fie for shame.

            \dia{Macb.} Blood hath bene shed ere now, i'th' olden time \\ Ere humane Statute purg'd the gentle Weale: \\ I, and since too, Murthers haue bene perform'd \\ Too terrible for the eare. The times has bene, \\ That when the Braines were out, the man would dye, \\ And there an end: But now they rise againe \\ With twenty mortall murthers on their crownes, \\ And push vs from our stooles. This is more strange \\ Then such a murther is.

            \dia{La.} My worthy Lord \\ Your Noble Friends do lacke you.

            \dia{Macb.} I do forget: \\ Do not muse at me my most worthy Friends, \\ I haue a strange infirmity, which is nothing \\ To those that know me. Come, loue and health to all, \\ Then Ile sit downe: Giue me some Wine, fill full: \\ \clStageDir{Enter Ghost.} \\ I drinke to th' generall ioy o'th' whole Table, \\ And to our deere Friend Banquo, whom we misse: \\ Would he were heere: to all, and him we thirst, \\ And all to all.

            \dia{Lords.} Our duties, and the pledge.

            \dia{Mac.} Auant, \& quit my sight, let the earth hide thee: \\ Thy bones are marrowlesse, thy blood is cold: \\ Thou hast no speculation in those eyes \\ Which thou dost glare with.

            \dia{La.} Thinke of this good Peeres \\ But as a thing of Custome: 'Tis no other, \\ Onely it spoyles the pleasure of the time.

            \dia{Macb.} What man dare, I dare: \\ Approach thou like the rugged Russian Beare, \\ The arm'd Rhinoceros, or th' Hircan Tiger, \\ Take any shape but that, and my firme Nerues \\ Shall neuer tremble. Or be aliue againe, \\ And dare me to the Desart with thy Sword: \\ If trembling I inhabit then, protest mee \\ The Baby of a Girle. Hence horrible shadow, \\ Vnreall mock'ry hence. Why so, being gone \\ I am a man againe: pray you sit still.

            \dia{La.} You haue displac'd the mirth, \\ Broke the good meeting, with most admir'd disorder.

            \dia{Macb.} Can such things be, \\ And ouercome vs like a Summers Clowd, \\ Without our speciall wonder? You make me strange \\ Euen to the disposition that I owe, \\ When now I thinke you can behold such sights, \\ And keepe the naturall Rubie of your Cheekes, \\ When mine is blanch'd with feare.

            \dia{Rosse.} What sights, my Lord?

            \dia{La.} I pray you speake not: he growes worse \& worse \\ Question enrages him: at once, goodnight. \\ Stand not vpon the order of your going, \\ But go at once.

            \dia{Len.} Good night, and better health \\ Attend his Maiesty.

            \dia{La.} A kinde goodnight to all. \elStageDir{Exit Lords.}

            \dia{Macb.} It will haue blood they say: \\ Blood will haue Blood: \\ Stones haue beene knowne to moue, \& Trees to speake: \\ Augures, and vnderstood Relations, haue \\ By Maggot Pyes, \& Choughes, \& Rookes brought forth \\ The secret'st man of Blood. What is the night?

            \dia{La.} Almost at oddes with morning, which is which.

            \dia{Macb.} How say'st thou that \textit{Macduff} denies his person \\ At our great bidding.

            \dia{La.} Did you send to him Sir?

            \dia{Macb.} I heare it by the way: But I will send: \\ There's not a one of them but in his house \\ I keepe a Seruant Feed. I will to morrow \\ (And betimes I will) to the weyard Sisters. \\ More shall they speake: for now I am bent to know \\ By the worst meanes, the worst, for mine owne good, \\ All causes shall giue way. I am in blood \\ Stept in so farre, that should I wade no more, \\ Returning were as tedious as go ore: \\ Strange things I haue in head, that will to hand, \\ Which must be acted, ere they may be scand.

            \dia{La.} You lacke the season of all Natures, sleepe.

            \dia{Macb.} Come, wee'l to sleepe: My strange \& self-abuse \\ Is the initiate feare, that wants hard vse: \\ We are yet but yong indeed. \elStageDir{Exeunt.}

            \dia{1.} Why how now Hecat, you looke angerly?

            \dia{Hec.} Haue I not reason (Beldams) as you are? \\ Sawcy, and ouer-bold, how did you dare \\ To Trade, and Trafficke with Macbeth, \\ In Riddles, and Affaires of death; \\ And I the Mistris of your Charmes, \\ The close contriuer of all harmes, \\ Was neuer call'd to beare my part, \\ Or shew the glory of our Art? \\ And which is worse, all you haue done \\ Hath bene but for a wayward Sonne, \\ Spightfull, and wrathfull, who (as others do) \\ Loues for his owne ends, not for you. \\ But make amends now: Get you gon, \\ And at the pit of Acheron \\ Meete me i'th' Morning: thither he \\ Will come, to know his Destinie. \\ Your Vessels, and your Spels prouide, \\ Your Charmes, and euery thing beside; \\ I am for th' Ayre: This night Ile spend \\ Vnto a dismall, and a Fatall end. \\ Great businesse must be wrought ere Noone. \\ Vpon the Corner of the Moone \\ There hangs a vap'rous drop, profound, \\ Ile catch it ere it come to ground; \\ And that distill'd by Magicke slights, \\ Shall raise such Artificiall Sprights, \\ As by the strength of their illusion, \\ Shall draw him on to his Confusion. \\ He shall spurne Fate, scorne Death, and beare \\ His hopes 'boue Wisedome, Grace, and Feare: \\ And you all know, Security \\ Is Mortals cheefest Enemie. \\ \clStageDir{Musicke, and a Song.} \\ Hearke, I am call'd: my little Spirit see \\ Sits in Foggy cloud, and stayes for me. \\ \elStageDir{Sing within.

            \StageDir{Enter Lenox, and another Lord.}
            \dia{Lenox.} My former Speeches, \\ Haue but hit your Thoughts \\ Which can interpret farther: Onely I say \\ Things haue bin strangely borne. The gracious \textit{Duncan} \\ Was pittied of \textit{Macbeth}: marry he was dead: \\ And the right valiant \textit{Banquo} walk'd too late, \\ Whom you may say (if't please you) \textit{Fleans} kill'd, \\ For \textit{Fleans} fled: Men must not walke too late. \\ Who cannot want the thought, how monstrous \\ It was for \textit{Malcolme}, and for \textit{Donalbane} \\ To kill their gracious Father? Damned Fact, \\ How it did greeue \textit{Macbeth}? Did he not straight \\ In pious rage, the two delinquents teare, \\ That were the Slaues of drinke, and thralles of sleepe? \\ Was not that Nobly done? I, and wisely too: \\ For 'twould haue anger'd any heart aliue \\ To heare the men deny't. So that I say, \\ He ha's borne all things well, and I do thinke, \\ That had he \textit{Duncans} Sonnes vnder his Key, \\ (As, and't please Heauen he shall not) they should finde \\ What 'twere to kill a Father: So should \textit{Fleans}. \\ But peace; for from broad words, and cause he fayl'd \\ His presence at the Tyrants Feast, I heare \\ \textit{Macduffe} liues in disgrace. Sir, can you tell \\ Where he bestowes himselfe?

            \dia{Lord.} The Sonnes of \textit{Duncane} \\ (From whom this Tyrant holds the due of Birth) \\ Liues in the English Court, and is receyu'd \\ Of the most Pious \textit{Edward}, with such grace, \\ That the maleuolence of Fortune, nothing \\ Takes from his high respect. Thither \textit{Macduffe} \\ Is gone, to pray the Holy King, vpon his ayd \\ To wake Northumberland, and warlike Seyward, \\ That by the helpe of these (with him aboue) \\ To ratifie the Worke) we may againe \\ Giue to our Tables meate, sleepe to our Nights: \\ Free from our Feasts, and Banquets bloody kniues; \\ Do faithfull Homage, and receiue free Honors, \\ All which we pine for now. And this report \\ Hath so exasperate their King, that hee \\ Prepares for some attempt of Warre.

            \dia{Len.} Sent he to \textit{Macduffe}?

            \dia{Lord.} He did: and with an absolute Sir, not I \\ The clowdy Messenger turnes me his backe, \\ And hums; as who should say, you'l rue the time \\ That clogges me with this Answer.

            \dia{Lenox.} And that well might \\ Aduise him to a Caution, t' hold what distance \\ His wisedome can prouide. Some holy Angell \\ Flye to the Court of England, and vnfold \\ His Message ere he come, that a swift blessing \\ May soone returne to this our suffering Country, \\ Vnder a hand accurs'd.

            \dia{Lord.} Ile send my Prayers with him. \elStageDir{Exeunt}
