            \dia{Macd.} Wherefore did you so?

            \dia{Macb.} Who can be wise, amaz'd, temp'rate, \& furious, \\ Loyall, and Neutrall, in a moment? No man: \\ Th' expedition of my violent Loue \\ Out-run the pawser, Reason. Here lay \textit{Duncan}, \\ His Siluer skinne, lac'd with His Golden Blood, \\ And his gash'd Stabs, look'd like a Breach in Nature, \\ For Ruines wastfull entrance: there the Murtherers, \\ Steep'd in the Colours of their Trade; their Daggers \\ Vnmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refraine, \\ That had a heart to loue; and in that heart, \\ Courage, to make's loue knowne?

            \dia{Donal.} What should be spoken here, \\ Where our Fate hid in an augure hole, \\ May rush, and seize vs? Let's away, \\ Our Teares are not yet brew'd.

            \dia{Mal.} Nor our strong Sorrow \\ Vpon the foot of Motion.

            \dia{Banq.} Looke to the Lady: \\ And when we haue our naked Frailties hid, \\ That suffer in exposure; let vs meet, \\ And question this most bloody piece of worke, \\ To know it further. Feares and scruples shake vs: \\ In the great Hand of God I stand, and thence, \\ Against the vndivulg'd pretence, I fight \\ Of Treasonous Mallice.

            \dia{Macd.} And so doe I.

            \dia{All.} So all.

            \dia{Macb.} Let's briefely put on manly readinesse, \\ And meet i'th' Hall together.

            \dia{All.} Well contented. \clStageDir{Exeunt.}

            \dia{Malc.} What will you doe? \\ Let's not consort with them: \\ To shew an vnfelt Sorrow, is an Office \\ Which the false man do's easie. \\ Ile to England.

            \dia{Don.} To Ireland, I: \\ Our seperated fortune shall keepe vs both the safer: \\ Where we are, there's Daggers in mens smiles; \\ The neere in blood, the neerer bloody.

            \dia{Malc.} This murtherous Shaft that's shot, \\ Hath not yet lighted: and our safest way, \\ Is to auoid the ayme. Therefore to Horse, \\ And let vs not be daintie of leaue-taking, \\ But shift away: there's warrant in that Theft, \\ Which steales it selfe, when there's no mercie left.
